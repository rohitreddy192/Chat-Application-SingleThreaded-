## Future Scope

While the current version of our Single-Threaded Chatting Application offers a basic chat experience, Multi threaded application provides a much better experience:

**Multi-Threading:** Implementation of multi-threading application can handle multiple clients concurrently. This would allow us to create a more robust chat application where users can chat simultaneously without waiting for their turn.
